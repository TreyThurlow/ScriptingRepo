All of the scripts in the BlueTeamScripts folder expects that you put the Microsoft.Powershell_profile.ps1 file in your WindowsPowerShell directory located in your documents.
$HOME\Documents\WindowsPowerShell

It is also required to PowerShell as Administrator. Do not use ISE as it does not link with the Microsoft.PowerShell_profile.ps1.

I did not create the Invoke-CommandAs module, Stop-Thread Module, or Get-InjectedThreads.ps1
