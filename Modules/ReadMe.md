With the exception of ARGUS, all of these modules were not created by me. They were pulled from PSGallery to save due to the importance of them and many networks do not allow you to easily install modules. 

I helped build ARGUS with a few co-workers. The idea of it is to perform daily checks of all servers on a network, to include VMs and ESXis. It is not currently working.
